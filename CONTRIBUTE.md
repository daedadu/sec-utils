#### Vision <a id='vision' />
The vision of this project is to create a fully open source downloading and parsing library for SEC documentation. Parsing SEC files is historically quite difficult. The formats for these files have changed over the years so what worked in the 1990's is completely outdated today. Coming up with universal parsing methods to take downloaded files and return specific sections is the vision of the project. 

For instance, a user can import the form 10-K from bulkedgar, point to their 10-K on prem or secure it directly from Edgar, and called the management discussion and analysis method to retrieve just the MD&A from the respective 10-K.

The forms of interest to start include:
- 10-K
- 10-Q
- DEF-14A
- S-1

#### Your first code contribution <a id='firstcontrib' />
Unsure where to begin contributing to bulkedgar? You can start by looking through the beginner and help-wanted issues:

Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.
